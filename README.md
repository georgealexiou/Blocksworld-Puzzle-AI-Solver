# AI Coursework

You will be given a search problem: details in problem.pdf. The assignment involves implementing the following types of search to solve this problem: depth first, breadth first, iterative deepening, and A* heuristic search. Examine how the time to reach the solution (or a solution of a given quality) increases/scales-up with problem size/difficulty (solution depth).

Do an approx. six page write-up of your work. (you can exclude example output from the page limit if nec.)

USE THESE HEADINGS:

   1. Approach (Approx one page: a brief description of your methods/the approach you took; if you had to make any decisions
      about exactly how to do things/if you did anything unusual, describe these) 
   2. Evidence of the 4 search methods in operation (include thorough evidence that your 4 methods work using detailed example       output over various scenarios, example solutions found; ie. debugging output that lets you (and me) know they are             working correctly - you can exclude example output from page count if necessary. Make sure you explain what I am looking       at.)
   3. Scalability study (~one page: describe how you controlled problem difficulty; one plot of your results for the 4 methods
      with respect to scalability, and brief interpretation of the results and discussion of their significance ->   
      conclusions)
   4. Extras and limitations (if you did anything extra, anything beyond what I asked for (eg space complexity,       more
   difficult version of problem). And limitations / self evaluation i.e. what are the weaknesses of the work you have       done - you can get extra marks for recognising your own weaknesses)
   5. References (if you used any)
   6. Code (the code you wrote, in human readable form) - not included in 6 page limit.
